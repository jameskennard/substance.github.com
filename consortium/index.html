    <h2>Substance Consortium</h2>
    <p class="large">In April 2016 the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/2016/04/27/substance-consortium/">Public Knowledge Project</a> (PKP), the <a href="http://coko.foundation/blog.html#substance_consortium">Collaborative Knowledge Foundation</a> (CoKo) and <a href="https://apropos.erudit.org/fr/creation-dun-consortium-autour-de-substance/">Érudit</a> partnered to form a consortium committed to supporting and integrating Substance. The idea is to create a common-pool resource whose development is driven by community needs. Everybody is invited to join.</p>
    <p>
      PKP’s Juan Pablo Alperin described the need for this consortium:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “We recognize that web-based multi-party editing of structured documents is needed in the authoring, editing, and production workflows of knowledge creation, and believe that we can best ensure Substance serves all these needs by coming together to support them. We hope that by making this commitment, others will recognize that there is more to gain from jointly supporting Substance’s work rather than building local or custom solutions that cannot easily be used by others.”
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>Roadmap</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.0 release of the <a href="http://github.com/substance/substance">Substance core library</a> (Fall 2016)</li>
      <li>Beta release of <a href="http://github.com/substance/scientist">Substance ScienceWriter</a>, a web-based JATS editor (Fall 2016)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!--<p>Your organization can support core development by considering a membership (monthly fee) or invest into work-packages to extend Substance Scientist functionality.</p>-->
