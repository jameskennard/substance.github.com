    <h2>Texture</h2>
    <p class="large">
      Texture is a toolset for the production of scientific content. It has first-class support for <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/">JATS</a>, the de facto standard for archiving and interchange of scientific open-access contents with XML.
    </p>

    <p>Get a feel for the Texture's possibilities by playing with these demos:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://github.com/substance/substance">Authoring</a>: Edit an eLife article like in a classic word processor</li>
      <li><a href="http://github.com/substance/substance">Quality Control</a>: Interface optimized for publishers to iterate on an article until it's ready for publication</li>
      <li><a href="http://github.com/substance/substance">Assisted Conversion</a>: An extension that offers a tagging mechanism to turn raw text into structured JATS</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>State of development</h3>
    <p>
      Texture builds on previous work done by <a href="/">Substance</a>, who are building web-based editing solutions for 6 years.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A functional prototype of a scientific editor was released in 2015 as <a href="https://medium.com/@_mql/produce-a-scientific-paper-with-lens-writer-d0fc75d11919#.btmmx0el0">Lens Writer</a></li>
      <li>In June 2016 <a href="https://github.com/substance/texture/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha">Texture Alpha</a> (funded by PKP) was released, adding loss-free JATS conversion</li>
      <li>In October 2016 <a href="https://github.com/substance/texture/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.2">Texture Alpha 2</a> (funded by Erudit) was published, providing a stabilized prototype</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The editor offers body and front matter editing for any JATS 1.1 XML document. Implementations for most important elements are in place, such as paragraphs, sections, figures, and references. In the coming months support for missing elements will be added and the goal is to cover as many use-cases as possible and get the software ready for production. Texture will replace the editing workflow for Consortium Erudit and be packaged with Open Journal Systems (OJS).
    </p>

    <h3>Open Roadmap</h3>
    <p>
      Development of Texture will be prioritized to meet the needs of the <a href="../consortium">community</a>, with clear avenues for community input and discussion. Decisions are made in a transparent manner, with regular communication about current and upcoming development. See the current state of the Product Brief, until we have worked out a roadmap, which will be published here.
    </p>

    <h3>License</h3>
    <p>
      Texture is open source, and you are legally free to use it commercially. If you are using Texture to make profit, we expect that you help fund
      its development and maintenance.
