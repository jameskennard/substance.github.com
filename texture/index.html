    <h2>Texture</h2>
    <p class="large">
      Texture is a toolset for the production of scientific content. It has first-class support for <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/">JATS</a>, the de facto standard for archiving and interchange of scientific open-access contents with XML.
    </p>

    <p>Get a feel for the Texture's possibilities by playing with these demos:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./examples/author.html">Authoring</a>: Edit a scientific article like in a classic word processor</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/publisher.html">Quality Control</a>: Interface optimized for publishers to iterate on an article until it's published</li>
      <li><a href="./examples/tagging.html">Assisted Conversion</a>: An extension that offers tagging to turn raw text into structured JATS</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>State of development</h3>
    <p>
      Texture builds on the work of <a href="/">Substance</a>, who are developing web-based editing solutions for 6 years. The following milestones have been achieved so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A functional prototype of a scientific editor was released in 2015 as <a href="https://medium.com/@_mql/produce-a-scientific-paper-with-lens-writer-d0fc75d11919#.btmmx0el0">Lens Writer</a></li>
      <li>In June 2016 <a href="https://github.com/substance/texture/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha">Texture Alpha</a> (funded by Public Knowledge Project) was released, adding loss-free JATS conversion</li>
      <li>In October 2016 <a href="https://github.com/substance/texture/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.2">Texture Alpha 2</a> (funded by Érudit) was published, providing a stabilized prototype</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The editor offers body and front matter editing for any JATS 1.1 XML document. Implementations for most important elements are in place, such as paragraphs, sections, figures, and references. In the coming months support for missing elements will be added and the goal is to cover as many use-cases as possible and get the software ready for production. Texture will be packaged with Open Journal Systems (OJS) and be a critical part in Érudit's new production workflow.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Roadmap</h3>
    <p>
      Development of Texture will be prioritized to meet the needs of the <a href="../consortium">community</a>, with clear avenues for community input and discussion. Decisions are made in a transparent manner, with regular communication about current and upcoming development.
    </p>
