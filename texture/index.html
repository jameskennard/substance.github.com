    <p class="large">
      Texture is a toolset for the production of scientific content. It uses the <a href="http://github.com/substance/dar">Dar Format</a>, which defines a stricter form of the <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/1.1/">JATS Archiving and Interchange Tag Set ("green" v. 1.1)</a> XML format.
