    <h3>A familiar editing experience</h3>
    <p>Texture feels like the word processor you are used to. It allows structured editing of scientific content and includes support for Figures, Tables, References, Supplementary files and more.</p>
    <h3>Document Archive</h3>
    <p>Texture uses an open file format (<strong>.dar</strong>) for storage. It is essentially a zip archive, containing the manuscript as a standard JATS XML file, as well as additional assets such as images and data files.</p>
    <h3>Supporting an end to end publishing workflow</h3>
    <p>Texture is the first editor, that is designed for publishers and authors. The idea is that interaction between authors and journals becomes seamless, improving the overall speed of digital publishing.</p>

    <h3>Designed by scientists and publishers like you</h3>
    <p>Scientists and publishers are helping us to define new features, that best support their daily use-cases. With your input we want to take Texture further and help remove the technical pain points from publishing. So that scientists can focus fully on their research, and publishers can focus on ensuring high quality content.</p>
    <h3>Interested in using Texture and contributing to its development?</h3>
    <p>Please get in touch with us, we are glad to help you find the best way to make use of Texture in your organisation. Please also have a look at the public Product Brief document, which serves us as a collaborative roadmap.</p>
    <p>You can help us with testing the application and submit bug reports. You can sponsor features, that are on the public roadmap but haven’t been implemented yet. And you can work with us to define missing features and get them on the roadmap.</p>
    <h3>License</h3>
